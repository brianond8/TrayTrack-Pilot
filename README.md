### **Step 4: Verify Your Folder Structure**

Your `traytrack-deploy` folder should now look like this:
```
traytrack-deploy/
├── main.py              ✅
├── index.html           ✅
├── requirements.txt     ✅
├── .gitignore          ✅
├── sw.js               ✅
├── manifest.json       ✅
├── README.md           ✅
├── caseflow.db         (exists but won't be pushed - that's ok)
